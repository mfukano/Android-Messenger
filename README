An android app developed for CMPS 121: Mobile App Development at the University of California, Santa Cruz. This app allows you to post bulletin messages anonymously in your area (a range of a few hundred meters); then, if you so wish, you can click on any bulletin and be permitted to begin anonymously chatting to the host of the bulletin message.
